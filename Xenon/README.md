# Xenon

Simple mod for WEBFISHING that I will gradually update overtime with more stuff.

- Grow upon gambling, just a little fun feature that I implemented as its own standalone mod at some point. This is configurable too.
- Ability to modify player walk/sprint speed, dive distance, jump height, gravity, etc.
